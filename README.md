# Brieflow

Extensible pipeline tool for processing optical pooled screens data.

We are actively moving code from [OpticalPooledScreens](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/OpticalPooledScreens).
Please check back for updates! 

## Definitions

Terms mentioned throughout the code and documentation include:
- **Brieflow library**: Code in [workflow/lib](workflow/lib) used to perform Brieflow processing.
Used with Snakemake to run Brieflow steps.
- **Process/Workflow**: Used synonymously to refer to larger steps of the Brieflow pipeline.
Example processes/workflows: `preprocessing`, `sbs_process`, `phenotype_process`
- **Sub-process**: Refers to a smaller step within a process.
Sub-processes use scripts and Brieflow library code to complete tasks.
Example sub-processes in the preprocessing process: `extract_metadata_sbs`, `convert_sbs`, `calculate_ic_sbs`.


## Project Structure

Brieflow is built on top of [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#snakemake).
We follow the [Snakemake structure guidelines](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html) with some exceptions.
The Brieflow project structure is as follows:

```
workflow/
├── envs/ - Environment YAML files that describe dependencies for different workflows.
├── lib/ - Brieflow library code used for performing Brieflow processing. 
├── rules/ - Snakemake rule files for each process. Used to organize sub-processses within each process with inputs, outputs, parameters, and script file location.
├── scripts/ - Python script files for sub-processes. Called by processes.
├── targets/ - Snakemake files used to define inputs and their mappings for each process.
└── Snakefile - Main Snakefile used to call processes.
```


## Running Example Analyis

Brieflow is set up as a Snakemake workflow with user configuration between steps where necessary. 
Thus, a user must configure parameters between workflow steps with configuration notebooks.
This example analysis details the steps necessary for configuring parameters and running step workflows.
While each step's workflow has its own Conda environment (compiled by Snakemake at runtime), the notebooks all share a configuration environment.

### Step 1: Set up workflow/configuration Conda environments

The workflows share a base environment (`brieflow_workflows`) and each have their own Conda environments compiled by Snakemake at runtime (in [workflow/envs](workflow/envs)).
All notebooks share a configuration environment (`brieflow_configuration`).

*Note*: We do not include the data necessary for this example analysis in this repo as it is too large.

#### Step 1a: Set up Brieflow workflows environment

Use the following commands to set up the `brieflow_workflows` Conda environment:

```sh
# create brieflow_workflows conda environment
conda env create --file=brieflow_workflows_env.yml
# activate brieflow_workflows conda environment
conda activate brieflow_workflows
# set conda installation to use strict channel priorities
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

#### Step 1b: Set up Brieflow configuration environment

Use the following commands to set up the `brieflow_configuration` Conda environment:

```sh
# create brieflow_configuration conda environment
conda env create --file=brieflow_configuration_env.yml
```

### Step 2: Run example analysis in steps

Follow the instructions below to configure paramers and run wokflows.
All of these steps are done in the example analysis folder.
Use the following command to enter this folder:
`cd example_analysis`.

#### Step 2.0: Configure preprocess params

Follow the steps in [0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb](example_analysis/0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb) to configure preprocess params.

#### Step 2.1: Run preprocessing workflow

```sh
conda activate brieflow_workflows
sh 1.run_preprocessing.sh
```

#### Step 2.2: Configure SBS/phenotype process params

1) Follow the steps in [2.configure_sbs_process_params.ipynb](example_analysis/2.configure_sbs_process_params.ipynb) to configure SBS process params.
2) Follow the steps in [3.configure_phenotype_process_params.ipynb](example_analysis/3.configure_phenotype_process_params.ipynb) to configure phenotype process params.

#### Step 2.3: Run SBS/phenotype process workflow

```sh
conda activate brieflow_workflows
sh 4.run_sbs_phenotype_processes.sh
```

***Note**: Use `brieflow_configuration` Conda environment for each configuration notebook.


### Run entire example analysis

If all parameter configurations are known for the entire Brieflow pipeline, it is possible to run the entire pipeline with the following:

```sh
cd example_analysis
sh run_entire_analysis.sh
```


## Contribution Notes


### Dev Tools

We use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting code.


### Conventions

We use the following conventions:
- [One sentence per line](https://nick.groenen.me/notes/one-sentence-per-line/) convention for markdown files
- [Google format](format) for function docstrings
- [tsv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values#:~:text=Tab%2Dseparated%20values%20(TSV),similar%20to%20comma%2Dseparated%20values.) file format for saving small dataframes that require easy readability
- [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) file format for saving large dataframes
- Data location information (well, tile, cycle, etc) + `__` + type of information (cell features, phenotype info, etc) + `.` + file type. 
Data is stored in its respective analysis directories. 
For example: `analysis_root/preprocess/ic_fields/sbs/A1_T1_C1__ic_field.tiff`
