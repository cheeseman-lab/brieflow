Brieflow is an extensible computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis of optical pooled screening data.

This repo contains the source code for running an OPS screen analysis.
[Brieflow Analysis](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis) contains configuration notebooks/files and execution scripts for running an OPS screen analysis.

## Getting Started

We strongly suggest that Brieflow is set up with the companion [Brieflow Analysis](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis) repository.
