# 0. Brieflow <> Brieflow Analysis

## Overview

Brieflow and brieflow-analysis are closely related repositories built together and, usually, both used for a screen analysis.
We distinguish these repositories like so:
- brieflow: code to process OPS data on a large scale
- brieflow-analysis: notebooks, files, and scripts that are used during a brieflow run

Both of these work together to run modules for steps like preprocessing, SBS, phenotype, etc.
Let's take a closer look:

## Brieflow

Brieflow has the following components:

- lib: Brieflow library code used for performing Brieflow processing. Organized into module-specific, shared, and external code.
- rules: Snakemake rule files for each module. Used to organize processses within each module with inputs, outputs, parameters, and script file location.
- scripts: Python script files for processes called by rules. Organized into module-specific and shared code.
- targets: Snakemake files used to define inputs and their mappings for each module
- Snakefile: Main Snakefile used to call modules.

One of the simplest examples for this is read calling during the SBS step.
We can approach this from a top -> down perspective to understand what is going on.

1) In the main [Snakefile](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow/blob/main/workflow/Snakefile) we tell Snakemake to include the rules and targets for the entire SBS module:
```python
if "sbs" in config and len(sbs_wildcard_combos) > 0:

    # Include target and rule files
    include: "targets/sbs.smk"
    include: "rules/sbs.smk"
```
2) Snakemake first looks at the [targets](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow/blob/main/workflow/targets/sbs.smk) to see what we want produced. The read calling output file is specified here: 
```python
"call_reads": [
    SBS_FP
    / "tsvs"
    / get_filename(
        {"plate": "{plate}", "well": "{well}", "tile": "{tile}"}, "reads", "tsv"
    ),
],
```
3) Snakemake then looks through the [rules](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow/blob/main/workflow/rules/sbs.smk) to see what needs to be run to produce this file. We need to run the following rule to get the `call_reads` output:
```python
rule call_reads:
    input:
        SBS_OUTPUTS["extract_bases"],
        SBS_OUTPUTS["find_peaks"],
    output:
        SBS_OUTPUTS_MAPPED["call_reads"],
    params:
        call_reads_method=config["sbs"]["call_reads_method"]
    script:
        "../scripts/sbs/call_reads.py"
```
This process takes 2 inputs, produces 1 output, and passes one param to the script to do so.
4) Snakemake loads the [script](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow/blob/main/workflow/scripts/sbs/call_reads.py) for this rule:
```python
from lib.sbs.call_reads import call_reads

# load bases data
bases_data = pd.read_csv(snakemake.input[0], sep="\t")

# load peaks data
peaks_data = imread(snakemake.input[1])

# call reads
reads_data = call_reads(
    bases_data=bases_data,
    peaks_data=peaks_data,
    method=snakemake.params.call_reads_method,
)

# save reads data
reads_data.to_csv(snakemake.output[0], index=False, sep="\t")
```
This is a very simple script that loads data, calls a function, and saves data.
5) Finally, snakemake accesses the [library code](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow/blob/eb4f58947eaeb1f2dd2c7df8fb1a9f593148a55f/workflow/lib/sbs/call_reads.py#L26) that we use here:
```python
def call_reads(
    bases_data,
    peaks_data=None,
    correction_only_in_cells=True,
    normalize_bases_first=True,
    method="median",
):
    """Call reads for in situ sequencing data.

    Call reads by compensating for channel cross-talk and calling the base
    with the highest corrected intensity for each cycle.

    Args:
    bases_data : pandas DataFrame
        Table of base intensity for all candidate reads, output of extract_bases.
...
```

## Brieflow Analysis

The analysis repo holds the files neccessary for configuring and running brieflow.
In the case of the read calling function above we:
1) Run the [2.configure_sbs_params.ipynb](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis/blob/main/analysis/2.configure_sbs_params.ipynb) notebook.
2) Set the `CALL_READS_METHOD` parameter in this notebook.
```python
# Define parameters for extracting bases
CALL_READS_METHOD = "median"
```
3) Save this parameter to the config file at the end of the notebook:
```python
config["sbs"] = {
    ...
    "call_reads_method": CALL_READS_METHOD,
    ...
}

# Write the updated configuration back with markdown-style comments
with open(CONFIG_FILE_PATH, "w") as config_file:
    # Write the introductory markdown-style comments
    config_file.write(CONFIG_FILE_HEADER)

    # Dump the updated YAML structure, keeping markdown comments for sections
    yaml.dump(config, config_file, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False)
```
4) This parameter gets passed to the snakemake rule during a run (see above)
```python
rule call_reads:
...
    params:
        call_reads_method=config["sbs"]["call_reads_method"]
...
```

## Reproducibility and Modularity

Brieflow and brieflow-analysis are built for reproducibility and modularity.
This setup enables researchers to
- work on a specific process within brieflow (ex, make siloed changes to `call_reads`)
- develop versions of brieflow that can be used across multiple brieflow-analysis repositories (ex, a `custom_screen` branch for brieflow can be used in multiple brieflow-analysis repos)
- track exact differences between the `main` branch of brieflow and a custom branch
- host an entire screen analysis on GitHub for reproducibility
