# 2. Installation & Analysis Setup

To get set up a screen analysis, follow the brieflow-analysis [setup instructions](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up).
We show an example setup below.

*Note* it is possible to reuse a brieflow installation across analyses, or use it without an analysis repository entirely.
Simply install brieflow and import the library code for use in a Jupyter notebook, Python script, etc.

Below is a video demonstration of the setup process for screen analysis:
