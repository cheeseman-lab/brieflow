# 4. Visualization

## Overview

Brieflow includes a Streamlit-based visualizer for exploring your screen results.
Use it to review experiment metadata, verify analysis configuration, explore quality control metrics, and investigate clustering results interactively.

The visualizer is particularly useful for:
- Sharing results with collaborators who don't need to run the pipeline
- Quickly checking QC metrics across plates and wells
- Exploring gene clusters and their biological interpretations

**Note:** The visualizer reads from your analysis outputs.
Run it after completing the modules whose results you want to explore (e.g., run the `aggregate` and `cluster` modules before using "Cluster Analysis" section of the visualization).

## Getting Started

Navigate to the analysis directory and activate your conda environment:

```sh
cd analysis/
conda activate brieflow_SCREEN_NAME
```

Then launch the visualizer:

```sh
sh 12.run_visualization.sh
```

This opens the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Environment Variables

The visualizer is configured via environment variables.
The run script (`12.run_visualization.sh`) sets sensible defaults, but you can override them for custom setups.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BRIEFLOW_OUTPUT_PATH` | Yes | `brieflow_output/` | Path to pipeline output directory |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Yes | `config/config.yml` | Path to analysis configuration file |
| `SCREEN_PATH` | Yes | `screen.yaml` | Path to screen metadata file |
| `STATIC_ASSET_URL_ROOT` | No | None | URL prefix for static assets (deployment) |
| `STATIC_ASSET_PATH` | No | None | Filesystem path for static assets (deployment) |

**Note:** The static asset variables (`STATIC_ASSET_URL_ROOT`, `STATIC_ASSET_PATH`) are only needed for deployed instances where images are served from a separate location.
For local development, leave them unset.

## Application Sections

The visualizer has four main sections accessible via the left sidebar navigation.

### Experimental Overview

Displays the experiment metadata from `config/screen.yml`.
This includes:

- Screen information (experiment ID, dates, notebook references)
- Cellular conditions (cell line, treatments, plate layout)
- SBS settings (cycles, library details)
- Phenotype settings (background channels)
- Imaging rounds and stains

This page provides a human-readable summary of what was screened and how.

### Analysis Overview

Shows the technical configuration used to run the pipeline, organized into three tabs:

- **Config**: The full `config.yml` file with all module parameters
- **Git**: Repository URL and current commit hash for reproducibility
- **Dependencies**: The conda environment specification

**Note:** The Git tab is useful for documenting exactly which version of Brieflow produced your results.

### Quality Control

Interactive exploration of QC metrics generated during pipeline execution.
Use the sidebar filters to navigate by:

- **Phase**: Which pipeline module (sbs, phenotype, merge, aggregate)
- **Subgroup**: Type of QC output (features, mapping, segmentation)
- **Plate/Well**: Specific samples
- **Metric**: Individual QC measures

The main panel displays distribution plots and data tables for the selected filters.

**Note:** Start with Phase and Subgroup filters to narrow down to the metrics you're interested in, then drill into specific plates and wells.

### Cluster Analysis

Interactive visualization of gene clustering results using PHATE dimensionality reduction.

**Sidebar filters:**
- **Channel Combo**: Feature subset used during aggregation
- **Cell Class**: Cell population (all, Mitotic, Interphase)
- **Leiden Resolution**: Clustering granularity

**Main panel:**
- **Gene/Cluster Search**: Dropdowns to locate specific genes or clusters
- **PHATE Plot**: Interactive scatter plot—click any point to select its cluster
- **Cluster Detail**: When a cluster is selected, shows:
  - LLM-generated biological interpretation (dominant process, gene classifications)
  - Data table with cluster members
  - Gene montages with UniProt annotations

The PHATE plot supports panning and zooming via controls in the top-right corner.

**Note:** LLM cluster analysis may only be available for certain cell class and resolution combinations.
If LLM results aren't showing, the app will display which filter combinations have LLM data available.

## Tips

- **Remote access**: If running on a remote server, use SSH port forwarding (`ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 user@server`) to access the visualizer in your local browser.
- **Multiple screens**: To compare screens side-by-side, run the visualizer from each screen's `analysis/` directory on different ports (e.g., `sh 12.run_visualization.sh -- --server.port=8502` for the second instance).
- **Cluster exploration**: Use the Gene Search dropdown to quickly locate a gene of interest, then click its point in the PHATE plot to see the full cluster context.
