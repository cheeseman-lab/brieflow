# Brieflow Analysis Setup

Brieflow is meant to be used as a submodule within [brieflow-analysis](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis), which holds the analysis files (configuration notebooks, screen-specific files, etc).
The quickstart example below is for setting up an entirely new analysis.
Note that it is possible to reuse a brieflow installation across analyses, or use it without an analysis repository entirely.

To get started, follow the [brieflow-analysis setup instructions](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up) as shown below.
