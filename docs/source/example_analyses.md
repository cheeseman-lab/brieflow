# Example Analyses

We include some reference analyses to illustrate how brieflow is used across screening contexts.

## Denali Screen

```

The Denali screen is one of the original screens used to build brieflow.
All of the code necessary for processing this screen is included in `main`.

**Screen Notes**:
- 4 channel screen targeting CENPA and mitochondrial invovlement with CENPA and WGA markers respectively
- 3 plates with 6 wells each

## Aconcagua Screen

```

The Aconcagua screen is one of the original screens used to test brieflow extension.
This is a reanalysis of the data originally collected for [Funk et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.10.017).

**Screen Notes**:
- 8 plates with 6 wells each, although some wells are excluded from analysis because of incorrectly acquired data
