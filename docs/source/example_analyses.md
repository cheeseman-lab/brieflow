# Example Analyses

We include some reference analyses to illustrate how brieflow is used across screening contexts.
See the `screen.yml` file (`brieflow-analysis/analysis/screen.yml`) in each of these repositories for screen notes regarding channels, plate/well setup, etc.

## Denali Screen

The Denali screen is one of the original screens used to build brieflow.
All of the code necessary for processing this screen is included in `main`.
