# Example Analyses

We include some reference analyses to illustrate how brieflow is used across screening contexts.
See the `screen.yml` file (`brieflow-analysis/analysis/screen.yml`) in each of these repositories for screen notes regarding channels, plate/well setup, etc.

## Denali Screen

The Denali screen is one of the original screens used to build brieflow.
All of the code necessary for processing this screen is included in `main`.

## Aconcagua Screen

The Aconcagua screen is one of the original screens used to test brieflow extension.
This is a reanalysis of the data originally collected for [Funk et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.10.017).
