# BrieFlow configuration file

# Defining samples:
#   Samples must be defined in the following TSV files with columns:
#     sbs_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile, cycle
#     phenotype_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile

# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved relative to the directory the workflow is run from
