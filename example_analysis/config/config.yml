# BrieFlow configuration file

# Defining samples:
#   Samples must be defined in the following TSV files with columns:
#     sbs_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile, cycle
#     phenotype_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile

# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved through the following rules:
#     1. If the path is absolute, the path is parsed as-is
#     2. If the path is not absolute, the path at 'root' is appended to it

# Suffixes:
#   Each subsection contains a 'suffix' key that defines the folder under
#   'output_fp' where the results of that section are put.


# General options
all:
  root_fp: "/Users/roshankern/Desktop/Github/BrieFlow/example_analysis/analysis_root"
  output_fp: "brieflow_output/"
  sbs_samples_fp: "/Users/roshankern/Desktop/Github/BrieFlow/example_analysis/config/sbs_samples.tsv"
  phenotype_samples_fp: "/Users/roshankern/Desktop/Github/BrieFlow/example_analysis/config/phenotype_samples.tsv"
