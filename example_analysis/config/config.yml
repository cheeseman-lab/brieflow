# BrieFlow configuration file

# Defining samples:
#   Samples must be defined in the following TSV files with columns:
#     sbs_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile, cycle
#     phenotype_samples.tsv: sample_fp, well, tile

# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved through the following rules:
#     1. If the path is absolute, the path is parsed as-is
#     2. If the path is not absolute, the path at 'root' is appended to it

# Suffixes:
#   Each subsection contains a 'suffix' key that defines the folder under


# General options
all:
  root_fp: "analysis_root/"

# Preprocessing
preprocess:
  suffix: preprocess
  sbs_samples_fp: "config/sbs_samples.tsv"
  phenotype_samples_fp: "config/phenotype_samples.tsv"

# SBS processing
sbs_process:
  suffix: sbs_process
  segmentation_cycle: -1 # apply ic field from last sequencing cycle
