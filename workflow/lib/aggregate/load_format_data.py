"""This module provides functions for loading and formatting data during aggregation.

Functions include:
- Loading a subset of data from parquet files for efficient processing.
- Cleaning cell data by removing unassigned or multi-gene cells.

Functions:
    - load_parquet_subset: Load a fixed number of random rows from a parquet file.
    - clean_cell_data: Clean cell data by filtering for valid and optionally single-gene cells.
