    This function calculates and visualizes the number of cells per well-tile combination in a plate layout.
    It uses `plot_plate_heatmap` to plot cell density across the specified plate type (e.g., '6W', '24W', '96W').

    Args:

            DataFrame containing cell data with columns 'well' and 'tile', where each row represents a cell
            located in a specific well and tile.
        shape (str, optional):
            Shape of the subplot for each well within the plate. Options include 'square', '6W_ph', '6W_sbs',
            or a list defining custom row layouts. Defaults to 'square'.

            Type of plate for plotting layout. Options are {'6W', '24W', '96W'}, which determine the overall
            layout of wells in the plot.
